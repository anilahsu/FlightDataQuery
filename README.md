# FlightDataQuery
This is a flight database built for the company's health insurance division. 
By connecting with the front-end flight inquiry platform, 
it assists the claim settlement unit to inquire about flight history and real-time information.

## Purpose
Travel inconvenience insurance in company health insurance In the process of claim settlement, 
every time a customer makes a claim, 
he needs to apply for a flight delay document to the airline and provide it to the company's claim unit so that the claim unit can verify the fact of the flight delay,
which not only increases the process by which a customer makes a claim, and it also takes time for a claims adjuster to check and confirm the fact that the flight was delayed.
To this end, 
a flight information database was designed using publicly available information from the Ministry of Transportation, which is regularly updated every fifteen minutes.

Through the front-end platform, 
the assisting claim settlement unit can directly query the flight history and real-time information.
